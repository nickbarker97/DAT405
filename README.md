DAT405 submission - generative art

<p>in my project i started off by looking at code i had already written and looked at which i found the most intersting.
i started to design my generative art by starting with a falling ball and lines randomly appearing above the falling ball. i ended up scraping this idea as there wasnt a way of getting anything different to appear.
next i started by creating the base for my finished product. because i knew i could create similar code for lines and triangles i decided to start with lines. i developed the random star code whch looked good but didnt fit what i was looking for but i kept it until i had finished everything else. i changed it to triangles at the very last minute. next i started work on the ellipse. at first i tried to get it to bounce.but because i hadnt done the code by myself i struggled to complete this. so instead i went for something which i could remember which ended up being a circular motion. i then made the code for the random colours which was very simple.</p>

<p>this repo is intended to allow the user to get images which will vary each time. i belive i have achieved this and you can try it for yourself. if you open the webpage and wait 4 - 10 seconds then right click on the image and save it. each time should reveal a completly different image. you can wait shorter or longer amounts of time but i feel this time varies the most between images.</p>
